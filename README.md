Hi ,
So to run the frontend, go to the root directory of frontend i.e notetakingapp and then -
run - npm i 
then, ng serve  ----This will run the frontend

To the run the backend,
Go to the root directory of backend i.e, backend and then -
run - npm i
then, nodemon index.js   ----This will run the backend

To connect with the mongoDB database,
Make sure you got mongodb compass desktop, connect with it.

If you find any issue, ping me on - amaanraja98@gmail.com
